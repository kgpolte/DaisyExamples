## Description

A dual-mono guitar effect using the Daisy Seed platform and based on the PedalPCB Terrarium.

This is the first working version of the the code (6-15-2024).

I still need to continue verifying all the hardware functionality, namely the switches and LEDs.

## Parameters:

- Delay Time
- Mix
- Feedback
