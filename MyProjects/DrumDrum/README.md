# DrumDrum

## Description

A kick drum generator based on analog synthesis techniques, using an 
oscillator with envelopes modulation pitch and amplitude.

This project used the Drum.cpp from the DaisyExamples repo as a
starting point with the intention of adding as much control as possible.

I ultimately plan to build this into a Eurorack module.

## Needed changes/additions:

I still need to get the CV input handling correct in the code - I've run into
some strange issues that I have yet to understand, but all of the other 
controls are currently working.
